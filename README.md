# Task Management System

A simple task management application built with Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to track daily tasks, set review reminders based on Ebbinghaus' forgetting curve, and manage task completion.

## Features

- **Task Addition**: Add tasks for today or any past date.
- **Review Scheduling**: Automatically schedule review dates for tasks based on a predefined schedule.
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed, with all unfinished tasks highlighted in red.
- **Data Storage**: All task data is stored in a JSON file (`task_data.json`).
